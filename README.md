# Statehouse: a state engine for the home

V1 Go daemon that turns MQTT telemetry into a canonical
in-memory house/device state and derived MQTT events. See
`PLAN.md`-style requirements in `docs/` once they exist; the runtime
implements the V1 scope described in the originating spec.

## Build

```
go build ./cmd/statehouse
go test ./...
```

## Run

```
statehouse -config config/config.example.yaml
```

The config must declare which property this instance serves:

```yaml
site:
  id: home
  devices_namespace: devices_home
```

`devices_namespace` names the config namespace holding this site's devices, so adding
a second property is a config edit rather than a code change. It defaults to
`statehouse_devices` — the single shared namespace every service read before devices
were split per site — so an unedited config keeps reading exactly what it always read.

The older `site: home` scalar is still accepted and means `site: {id: home}`.

There is no default, and **statehouse refuses to start without it**. `site` is written
as a tag on every Influx point, which is what keeps `device_id` unambiguous once a
second property reports into the same bucket — a second site already exists in the
`sites` namespace, so this is not hypothetical. It is `site` and not `location`
because `location` is already in the data meaning a room.

Starting without it would write untagged points that look identical to the ambiguous
history the tag exists to prevent, and nothing would surface the mistake until the
data was already unrecoverable. A refused start is the cheaper failure.

> **Upgrading an existing deployment:** add `site:` to the host's config *before*
> deploying this version, or the service will not come back up on restart.

Points no longer carry a `location` tag. It was write-only — both read services
decoded it into a field neither ever read, and rooms resolve at read time from the
floorplan instead. Old points keep their stale tag and are simply unread, so there is
no backfill to get wrong and a room rename never touches stored data.

Points written before this tag existed carry no `site` at all. A consumer filtering on
`site == "home"` would silently exclude all of that history, so consumers treat an
absent tag as the primary site rather than filtering it away.

Endpoints:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /state`
- `GET /state/house`
- `GET /state/devices`
- `GET /state/devices/{id}`
- `GET /state/activity` — active signals and recent activity log.
- `GET /events/recent?limit=100`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /config/devices` — resolved profile (class, thresholds, strategy) for every known device.
- `GET /config/devices/{id}` — resolved profile for one device.

MQTT topics published under `house/`:

- `house/state/snapshot`        (retained)
- `house/state/house`           (retained)
- `house/state/devices/{id}`    (retained, per device)
- `house/events/derived`        (non-retained, one per derived event)

## Capturing fixtures

`cmd/fixture-capture` is a small CLI that subscribes to an MQTT broker
and writes each received message as one JSON line, in the exact shape
`internal/testdata/fixtures/*.jsonl` expects. Use it to record real
Zigbee2MQTT traffic — including across deliberate broker restarts —
for use as regression fixtures.

```
go build ./cmd/fixture-capture
./fixture-capture \
  -broker tcp://192.168.1.10:1883 \
  -topics "zigbee2mqtt/#" \
  -output internal/testdata/fixtures/my_capture.jsonl
```

It uses paho's auto-reconnect and emits synthetic marker records on
disconnect/reconnect so the timing of broker outages is preserved in
the fixture:

```
{"ts":"...","topic":"_capture/connection_lost","payload":{"error":"..."}}
{"ts":"...","topic":"_capture/reconnected","payload":{"downtime_ms":4123}}
```

Replay can ignore topics under `_capture/` or, in reconnect-specific
tests, assert on them. Output is flushed and fsynced after every line
so SIGKILL doesn't lose data.

Flags: `-broker`, `-client-id`, `-username`, `-password`, `-topics`
(comma-separated), `-output` (`-` for stdout), `-duration` (0 = until
SIGINT), `-qos`, `-mark-reconnects`.

## Architecture

The engine is protocol-agnostic. It accepts canonical `DeviceIdentity`
records (`Scheme` + `Primary` + `Display`) and protocol-normalised
`Reading` values; it does not know anything about Zigbee2MQTT,
Tasmota, Shelly or any other source. Protocol-specific behaviour lives
behind the `internal/adapter.Adapter` interface — one adapter per
source. To add a new source (e.g. Tasmota or Shelly), write an
adapter; the engine, store, energy code, and HTTP/MQTT outputs all
stay untouched.

Available adapters today:

- `internal/adapter/zigbee2mqtt` — Z2M bridge/devices + per-device
  payloads + availability.
- `internal/adapter/boiler` — [sweeney/boiler-sensor](https://github.com/sweeney/boiler-sensor)
  CH/HW relay events + lifecycle. Off by default; enable in config.
- `internal/adapter/ups` — Network UPS Tools (NUT) devices publishing
  aggregated state to `ups/{upsname}/state`. Off by default.
- `internal/adapter/climate` — weather stations publishing per-location
  observations to `{base}/{location}/observation`. Off by default.
- `internal/adapter/meter` — Glow/SMETS2 smart meters publishing to
  `energy/{serial}/SENSOR/electricitymeter`. Off by default.
- `internal/adapter/intercom` — Asterisk-via-MQTT phone system. Tracks
  in-flight calls as activity signals (`intercom_ringing`,
  `intercom_answered`, `intercom_hungup`). Off by default.

Device classes today:

- `short_burst_power_device` — kettles, toasters, microwaves.
- `cycle_power_device` — dishwasher, washing machine, dryer.
- `continuous_power_device` — fridge, freezer, dehumidifier.
- `media_power_device` — TV, AV, speakers.
- `binary_state_device` — boiler relays, contact sensors, motion
  sensors, switches that report ON/OFF without power. Activity
  derives from `Reading.State` not power; cycles record duration
  but no energy.
- `environmental_sensor` — measurement-only climate/air-quality/illuminance
  devices. No cycle, no activity machine — `Activity` stays at `reporting`
  while the device transmits. Temp / humidity / battery flow into the device
  record and into Influx as `device_environment` / `device_battery`.
- `ups_sensor` — UPS devices. Measurement-only like `environmental_sensor`
  but carries UPS-specific fields: `on_battery`, `low_battery`,
  `battery_runtime_mins`.
- `energy_meter` — whole-home electricity meters and IHD devices. Reports
  cumulative kWh and instantaneous power. No cycles, no occupancy
  contribution.

## Layout

- `cmd/statehouse` — daemon entrypoint.
- `cmd/fixture-capture` — MQTT-to-JSONL fixture recorder.
- `internal/adapter` — protocol-agnostic Adapter interface.
- `internal/adapter/zigbee2mqtt` — Z2M adapter.

- `internal/adapter/intercom` — Asterisk-via-MQTT intercom adapter.
- `internal/config` — YAML config + defaults.
- `internal/model` — canonical data types (Reading, Device, Event,
  Snapshot, House). Pointer fields keep the absent-vs-zero
  distinction.
- `internal/device` — device profiles, classification, state machines.
- `internal/energy` — counter, power-time integration with gap clamp,
  strategy selection, divergence helper.
- `internal/state` — in-memory store, engine, whole-house derivation.
- `internal/history` — bounded JSONL recent-event log + sink adapter.
- `internal/mqtt` — broker client, Z2M subscriber, derived publisher.

- `internal/httpapi` — HTTP JSON API.
- `internal/testutil` — fake clock, fixture loader.
- `internal/testdata/fixtures` — anonymised MQTT JSONL fixtures.

## Remote config

Device classification, per-device overrides, and behaviour tuning are
managed through a remote config service rather than the local YAML file.
On startup the daemon fetches three namespaces from the URL set in
`remote_config.base_url` (authenticated via the identity service):

- `statehouse_devices` — per-device overrides (class, thresholds,
  `energy_strategy`, `display_name`, `location`).
- `statehouse_classes` — device class definitions (name hints, default
  thresholds, energy strategy).
- `statehouse_behaviour` — runtime tuning (energy, availability, house,
  adapter config).

Remote values win over local config on overlap. A namespace that fails
to fetch is skipped non-fatally; the local config value is preserved.
The `/healthz` endpoint reports the fetch status of each namespace.

To update device config (e.g. override a device's energy strategy),
edit the remote config service — not the local YAML.

## Notes

- The engine refuses to integrate power across an interval larger
  than `energy.max_integration_gap` (default 30m). The cycle records
  this without smearing watts across the gap.
- Counter-based energy is preferred for `short_burst_power_device` and
  `cycle_power_device`; integration is preferred for
  `continuous_power_device` and `media_power_device`.
- If counter-reported and integrated energy disagree by more than
  `energy.divergence_warning_pct` (default 20%), an
  `energy_divergence_warning` derived event is emitted.
- Each device accumulates all-time extremes in memory, exposed as the
  `lifetime` block on the device API responses: peak power draw, plus
  min/max temperature and humidity, each with the timestamp it occurred.
  A device only carries the extremes for measurements it actually reports
  (a plug gets `max_power_w`; a climate sensor gets the temperature and
  humidity extremes). These are not persisted — they reset on restart —
  and are intended for UI use such as a current-vs-peak power dial.
- Offline availability is debounced (default 30s) so Z2M restart
  flicker does not produce alarms.
- Device identity is the IEEE address; friendly-name renames keep the
  underlying state.
